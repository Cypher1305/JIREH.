## ü§ù How we work

- **Tasks are created as issues** (by the scrum master [Cypher1305](https://github.com/Cypher1305))
- Each Contributor **assigns or receives an issue** ou en re√ßoit une
- A branch is **created from `dev`** for each issue (Always from dev branch)
- Commit messages must reference the issue ID
- A **pull request** (PR) is made to `dev`
- 1 branche = 1 fonctionnalit√© = 1 PR
- Once the PR has been accepted, **the branch is deleted**
